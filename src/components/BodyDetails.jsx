            </div>
            <p>I'm Akerele Taiwo, an enthusiast for frontend development. I started frontend development at the age of 16 and gained interest in it so i started working on improving myself with front-end development tools and learning online, i started with <a target='_blank' href="https://freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a> which i gained certificate on responsive web design, moved forward to <a target='_blank' href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/home">frontend mentor</a>  where i learnt interactivity on the web. The more i learnt about interactivity on the web the more i  was eager to learn more even though i faced challenges.
            Playing the pianoðŸŽ¹, watching movies and eating is what i use to relax my brain after a long day of writing codes, fixing bugs and deployingðŸ˜‚. </p>
